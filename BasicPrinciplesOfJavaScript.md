## Basic Principles Of JavaScript

# 1. What is JavaScript
JavaScript is a popular web scripting language and is used for client-side and server-side development. The JavaScript code can be inserted into HTML pages that can be understood and executed by web browsers while also supporting object-oriented programming abilities.
- object-oriented scripting language.
- run inside a web browser.
- does not need compilation before running the application code

# 2. Data Types of JavaScript
- Boolean - For true and false values
- Null - For empty or unknown values
- Undefined - For variables that are only declared and not defined or initialized
- Number - For integer and floating-point numbers
- String - For characters and alphanumeric values
- Object - For collections or complex values
- Symbols - For unique identifiers for objects

# 3. Type of Variables in JS
- automaticaly
- var - used in older browsers
- let - can be changed
- const - cannot be changed, creating objects or arrays, 

# 4. Creating Object in JS

const student = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 17
}

# 5. Operators in JS
## Arithmetick

- + 	Addition
- -	    Subtraction
- *	    Multiplication
- **	Exponentiation (ES2016)
- /	    Division
- %	     Modulus (Division Remainder)
- ++	Increment
- --	Decrement
## Assignment

 - =	   x = y	  x = y
- +=	 x += y	  x = x + y
- -=	 x -= y 	x = x - y
- *=	 x *= y	  x = x * y
- /=	 x /= y	  x = x / y
- %=	 x %= y	  x = x % y
- **=	 x **= y	x = x ** y
## Comparison

==	equal to
===	equal value and equal type
!=	not equal
!==	not equal value or not equal type
>  	greater than
<	  less than
>=	greater than or equal to
<=	less than or equal to
?	  ternary operator

## Logical 

&&	and
||	or
!	  not

# 6. What are the scopes of a variable in JavaScript?
- Global Scope - Global variables, having global scope are available everywhere in a JavaScript code.
- Local Scope - Local variables are accessible only within a function in which they are defined.

# 7.  What is Callback in JavaScript?
A callback is a JavaScript function that is passed to another function as an argument or a parameter. This function is to be executed whenever the function that it is passed to gets executed.
